# Amazon_Product_Review_Analysis
This case study analyzes 1,465 Amazon products across various categories to uncover key insights on pricing, customer reviews, and performance metrics. 
As a Junior Data Analyst at **RetailTech Insights**, I used Excel, Power Query, and Pivot Tables to clean data, answer 14 business questions, and create an interactive dashboard.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes scraped Amazon product data with:

- Product details: name, category, actual and discounted prices, discount %
- Review info: average rating, number of reviews
- Aggregated review text (not analyzed in this case)
- 16 columns × 1,465 rows

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Power Query (for cleaning & transformation)
  - Pivot Tables and Calculated Columns
  - Interactive Dashboard with Slicers & Charts

## Key Business Questions Solved

1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual price × rating count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount? (scatter plot)
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products by combined score (rating × review count)
